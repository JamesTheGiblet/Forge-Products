## 💡 Why This Works

**The pitch:** "Same math, your industry."

Every business has decay problems:
- Customer retention decaying
- Equipment performance degrading  
- Lead interest cooling
- Motivation declining
- Safety margins eroding

**Forge Products** applies proven mathematics to quantify, visualize, and predict these patterns - making the invisible visible and the uncertain predictable.

**What makes us different:**
- **8 years validation** (not a startup pivoting frantically)
- **Cross-domain expertise** (proves framework universality)
- **Fast execution** (ToothForge: 2h 16m concept-to-demo)
- **Physical proof** (hardware robots validate simulation predictions)
